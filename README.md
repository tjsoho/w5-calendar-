# Project Title

Week 5 Assignment: Calendar

## Description
The purpose of this READme is to provide a detailed description of my travel game.

This calendar allows users to input todo inside the hourly blocks. Upon refreshing the page the data remains in the blocks as it is receiving it back from local storage.

On top of that, the user can see a color code that indicates past, present and future time blocks.

The site can be accessed via this link:

### This repository contains:
* A READme file detailing the assignment and the site
* Html.index file
* Assets folder that contains the following:
* Png file of the site
* Css folder containing css style sheet
* JS folder contain js.script file

This site was built on top of using starter code. 

I began by creating elements in the HTML to fill all 8 hr time blocks of the day.
